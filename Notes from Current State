I've checked out the current state and notice this:

After opening the app, 
click on REGISTER, the TextView and EditView of Password and Confirm Passwords are mixed up.
click on LOGIN, no username and info required, which is good for now in our developing stage.
all buttons on Home Activity work fine.
in SEARCH, my typing started from the search icon, which is very annoying
in SEARCH, there is no "search" button, or do we just press Enter and it will search automatically??
can't get to ADDBOOK, there's no path to that.

Looking at the code,
there are some empty classes and interface.
